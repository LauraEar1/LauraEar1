# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Laura Earl** 

<img src="image.png" alt="Description" width="150" height="115">

and I'm in the third year of my undergrad at Dalhousie University. I am Majoring in Neuroscience with a certificate in [Neurotechnology and Innovation](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience/programs/certificate-programs/neurotech_innovation.html). 

## Why I'm Here

I started to be intrested in neuroscience and how the brain works in general after my grade 11 Biology teacher taught a short neuroscience unit. I **loved** the idea that there is still so much to discover and how there are so many different disiplines within the field that you can get into. Its the same kind of thinking that made me take this course (NESC3505). I want to know how to code so that I can use those skills on future projets. 

## Future Plans ðŸŽ“
After graduation I would like to, (*in no particular order*)... 
- Work on a BCI project
- Travel ðŸŒ†
- Complete a MBA
